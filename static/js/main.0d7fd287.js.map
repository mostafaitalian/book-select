The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world\\u2019s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer.

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.

Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.',\n\t    industryIdentifiers: [[Object], [Object]],\n\t    readingModes: { text: true, image: false },\n\t    pageCount: 342,\n\t    printType: 'BOOK',\n\t    categories: ['Computers'],\n\t    maturityRating: 'NOT_MATURE',\n\t    allowAnonLogging: true,\n\t    contentVersion: '1.4.3.0.preview.2',\n\t    panelizationSummary: { containsEpubBubbles: false, containsImageBubbles: false },\n\t    imageLinks: {\n\t        smallThumbnail: 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IOejDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api',\n\t        thumbnail: 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IOejDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'\n\t    },\n\t    language: 'de',\n\t    previewLink: 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IOejDAAAQBAJ&dq=redux+react&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api',\n\t    infoLink: 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IOejDAAAQBAJ&dq=redux+react&hl=&source=gbs_api',\n\t    canonicalVolumeLink: 'https://books.google.com/books/about/React.html?hl=&id=IOejDAAAQBAJ',\n\t    id: 'IOejDAAAQBAJ',\n\t    shelf: 'read'\n\t}, {\n\t    title: 'Satire TV',\n\t    subtitle: 'Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era',\n\t    authors: ['Jonathan Gray', 'Jeffrey P.

Shifts in industry economics and audience tastes have re-made television comedy, once considered a wasteland of escapist humor, into what is arguably the most popular source of political critique. From fake news and pundit shows to animated sitcoms and mash-up videos, satire has become an important avenue for processing politics in informative and entertaining ways, and satire TV is now its own thriving, viable television genre. Satire TV examines what happens when comedy becomes political, and politics become funny. A series of original essays focus on a range of programs, from The Daily Show to South Park, Da Ali G Show to The Colbert Report, The Boondocks to Saturday Night Live, Lil’ Bush to Chappelle’s Show, along with Internet D.I.Y. satire and essays on British and Canadian satire. They all offer insights into what today’s class of satire tells us about the current state of politics, of television, of citizenship, all the while suggesting what satire adds to the political realm that news and documentaries cannot.',\n\t    industryIdentifiers: [[Object], [Object]],\n\t    readingModes: { text: true, image: false },\n\t    pageCount: 288,\n\t    printType: 'BOOK',\n\t    categories: ['Performing Arts'],\n\t    maturityRating: 'NOT_MATURE',\n\t    allowAnonLogging: true,\n\t    contentVersion: '0.6.4.0.preview.2',\n\t    panelizationSummary: { containsEpubBubbles: false, containsImageBubbles: false },\n\t    imageLinks: {\n\t        smallThumbnail: 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',\n\t        thumbnail: 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'\n\t    },\n\t    language: 'en',\n\t    previewLink: 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=satire&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api',\n\t    infoLink: 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&source=gbs_api',\n\t    canonicalVolumeLink: 'https://market.android.com/details?id=book-1wy49i-gQjIC',\n\t    id: '1wy49i-gQjIC',\n\t    shelf: 'read'\n\t}];\n\t\n\tvar BooksApp = function (_React$Component) {\n\t    _inherits(BooksApp, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t    function BooksApp() {\n\t        var _ref;\n\t\n\t        var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\t\n\t        _classCallCheck(this, BooksApp);\n\t\n\t        for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n\t            args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = BooksApp.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(BooksApp)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _this.state = {\n\t            /**\n\t             * TODO: Instead of using this state variable to keep track of which page\n\t             * we're on, use the URL in the browser's address bar.

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world\\u2019s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don\\'t be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust.

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don't be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust.

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer.

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don't be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust.
